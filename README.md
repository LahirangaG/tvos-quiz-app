- **State Management**: The app uses `@State` to handle time limits for questions, user interactions, and score tracking, ensuring smooth transitions between screens.
- **Animations**: Simple animations are used to transition between screens and make the user experience more engaging.
- **Navigation**: Utilized `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink` for easy navigation between the splash screen, category selection, quiz questions, and the score screen.

(b) Why would someone want to invest on your project idea
- **Engagement**: A quiz app offers engaging content for various users, from students to trivia lovers, and offers a way to learn while having fun.
- **Educational Value**: The app can serve as an educational tool in classrooms or at home for interactive learning across different subjects.
- **Cross-Platform Reach**: tvOS allows the quiz application to be used in a living room setting, making it accessible to a broader audience using Apple TV.

#### 07. Reflection

**Challenges that you faced in doing this part of the assignment**
- **Time Management**: Managing the timing for each quiz question and ensuring smooth transitions between screens was challenging, especially when incorporating animations and navigation.
- **UI Consistency**: Ensuring the UI worked well with both the TV remote controls and different screen sizes required careful attention.
- **Testing on tvOS Devices**: Testing on actual tvOS devices posed some difficulties due to the limited screen space and the need for remote-based interaction.

**How would I have approached this Assignment differently**
- **Additional Testing**: I would have done more user testing, particularly with individuals unfamiliar with tvOS to ensure the navigation was intuitive.
- **Improved Performance**: I would have optimized the app for better performance, especially to ensure it ran smoothly across all tvOS devices.
- **Enhanced Design**: I would have incorporated more dynamic visual elements to make the quiz experience even more engaging.
